/*: question1
 ### 1. Write a function called `helloWorld()` that prints "Hello, world!" to the console. Then call it to see your string printed to the playground console.
 */
// write your code here
func helloWorld(){
    print("Hello, world!")
}
helloWorld()

// answer
//func helloWorld() {
//    print("Hello, world!")
//}
//
//helloWorld()

/*: question2
 ### 2. Write your own function in which you declare a constant inside the function's body and then print that constant to the console. Call this function to see your string printed to the playground console.
 */
// write your code here
func weatherCondition(){
    let status = "good"
    print("The weather today is \(status)")
}
weatherCondition()

// answer
func helloPerson() {
    let name = "Eddy"
    print("Hello, \(name)!")
}

helloPerson()
/*: question3
 ### 3. Write a function that takes a person's name as an argument and prints a greeting to the console. Call it several times with different arguments. What do you think you'll see in the console?
 */
// write your code here
func greeting(name: String){
    print("Hi \(name) how are you today?")
}
greeting(name: "Mike")
greeting(name: "Tom")
greeting(name: "Franc")

// answer
func helloName(name: String) {
    print("Hello, \(name)!")
}

helloName(name: "Jon")
helloName(name: "Jane")
helloName(name: "Edgar")
helloName(name: "Ruth")
/*: question4
 ### 4. Now call the function you wrote in Question 3 using a variable or constant instead of a string literal. What do you expect to see in the console? Try passing in a _variable_ you declared (using `var`) as an argument. Then change that variable's value and call your function again. What do you see in the console?
 */
// write your code here
var myName = "Dan"
greeting(name: myName)

// answer
let name1 = "Bobby"
helloName(name: name1)

var name2 = "George"
helloName(name: name2)
name2 = "Marcia"
helloName(name: name2)

/*: question5
 ### 5. Write your own function in which you declare a _variable_ (of any type) inside the function's body. Print out this variable to the console from within your function. After you print the variable once, assign a new value to this variable on the next line. Print it again (after the line on which you assign it to a new value). Call your function several times. What do you expect to see printed to the playground's console each time you call this function?
 */
// write your code here

func weatherReport(){
    var temperature = 30
    print("The temperature outside today will be \(temperature)")
    temperature = 35
    print("The temperature outside today will be \(temperature)")
}
weatherReport()
weatherReport()
weatherReport()

// answer
func helloVariable() {
    var greeting = "Hello"
    print("\(greeting), world!")
    greeting = "Guten Tag"
    print("\(greeting), world!")
}

helloVariable()
helloVariable()
helloVariable()
